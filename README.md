# Zap-Map Technical Challenge

Hello! Here at Zap-Map, we love a good API. Your challenge is to develop a single restful API endpoint which should return Location points for a region on a map.

You should program this in PHP and MySQL (bonus points if you use Laravel), but we donâ€™t want you to spend too long on it, only an hour or two, your time is precious. Itâ€™s fine if you only complete half of it or it errors somewhere, what really matters is that we can get a feel for how you would go about this challenge and how you would structure your code.

* The data for this challenge is in `data.csv`.
* Create a database and migrate the data from that file.
* There only needs to be a single endpoint.
* That endpoint should accept three parameters:
    * latitude
    * longitude
    * radius
* It should return a response of all Locations that fall within that radius.

If you have any questions, then please do contact usâ€”we are a friendly bunch and want you to succeed! Once the challenge has been completed (or not, as might very well be the caseâ€¦) then please send it across to us with any instructions that you think we might need.

Happy coding!
